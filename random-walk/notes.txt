Perlin's problem is it's so expensive.  It does so many passes.  It requires interpolation.

What if we tweaked the likelihood of each outcome and just did a random walk?

But what do we tweak the likelihoods with?

As we're going, generate a random number, if it's less than some amount, regenerate likelihoods.
  - That will make startling changes.  What if we want gradual changes too?

We want some combination of gradual and startling changes.

The problem with this method is it's O(n) to generate a single point -- the point furthest to the right.  The beauty of perlin is you don't have to add up every point since the origin to get a single point.
