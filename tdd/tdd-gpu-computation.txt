Why do we want to do calculations on the GPU?  Because they're faster.

So, our test should read assertIsFast(calculation).

But that kind of test is unreliable!  How do we make it repeatable?

We could run it multiple times, then assert based on the fastest/slowest/average time.

Which of those is most reliable?

TODO: Run a short(ish) calculation hundreds of times and graph the results to determine which measurement is most reliable.

Is it reliable enough for TDD?

But we can TDD that too!  How about: assertIsReliable(test) or (more granular) assertDataConsistent(speedRunResults)

But even that will be too slow...

That's a good candidate for a "slow" test suite that's only run occasionally.
