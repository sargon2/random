code: render "hello world"
tests: does it render "hello world"?

extract variable
code: render var
tests: does it render var?
config: var = "hello world"

but then config is untested!
config: var = "hello world"
test config: var should = "hello world"

config should be untested.  config is both tests and code, deduped.

is what I'm writing config?
 - are the code and the tests for it identical except for replacing = with assertEqual?
