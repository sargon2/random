1. (done) Get list of all app IDs - GET https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/GetAppList/v2/

Either for all games or for a random sampling of them:
1. Get total number of reviews
1. Get sale price
1. Ideally get release date

Then, make a graph of number of reviews by price.  Maybe per year or per month or something.

Then, assume a 30:1 or 60:1 ratio or whatever of reviews to sales, and calculate profit by price.  This should aid in pricing a game.

Notes:

This API has number of reviews, but also has a list of reviews: https://store.steampowered.com/appreviews/440?json=1&language=all&purchase_type=all
