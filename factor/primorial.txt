A primorial is like a factorial, but for primes.

e.g. 2*3*5*7*11*...

You could factor the large non-square semiprime n by:
1. Calculate some giant primorial to be used for all your factoring needs.  Call this p.
2. x=p/n # It will be divisible because n is a non-squre semiprime.
3. Factor x.  It will be easy because it has lots of small factors.
4. The list of factors of x will be missing two primes.  Those are the divisors of n.

Problems:
1. The giant primorial will be too giant to store in our universe.
2. Is factoring x actually easy?  I kind of think so.
3. Detecting which primes are missing from the list of factors of x may not be easy.
