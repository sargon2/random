Questions:

1) What are the top N books for which I know the highest percentage of kanji? Are there any books that I know 100% of the kanji in?
2) What kanji would it be most beneficial for me to learn?


make a list of all the kanji I know (based on my incidental kanji deck)
make an overall map of the number of times each character is seen
for each book:
  count seen and not seen characters
