games db (arbitrary db)

items have:
 - item id
 - images (really just a tag with a uri in it)
 - arbitrary file attachments (tag w/ uri)
 - arbitrary text fields
 - arbitrary numeric fields? price? metascore
 - tags
 - a game can have a link to a set of game characters?

so there are things, and relationships between things, and tags, and tags with values (text, numeric, ...?)
maybe relationships have tags too?

nodes, edges, tags, tags with values?  are tags with values just nodes? no, they can be irrational numbers. game_disc_circumference


(super mario world) ---- character is in ---- (yoshi)

(super mario world) ---- (metascore critic: 123)
(super mario world) ---- (metascore user: 89)
(super mario world) --123-- (metascore critic score)
(super mario world) --89-- (metascore user score)

making tags a node overcomplicates things.

super mario world has tag: metascore critic 123

super mario world has tag: characters, which contains links to nodes: mario yoshi

 - a tag can have a list of nodes in it

nodes have types? game, game character, etc.

So, nodes exist.  Nodes have types.  Nodes have tags.  Tags can have values.  Tag values can be strings, numbers, or a list of nodes of any type.

bottle vs. django vs. flask vs. pyramid: testing looks easiest in flask, so use that.
