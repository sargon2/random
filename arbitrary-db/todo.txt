(done) The default page should tell you if there are no nodes.
(done) If you click a link on the default page to a node, you should get the node page.
(done) If there's at least one node, the default page should provide you a way to get to at least one node.
(done) The node page should contain a list of tags.

Tag values
Right now, we're only storing one tag on a node.  A tag string like "a, b" should be parsed into two tags.
The node page should contain the node type.
If there are 10 trillion nodes, the default page should not show all 10 trillion.
The default page should give you a way to (filter?) by node type.
If a node page shows a tag that contains a list of nodes, you should be able to click those nodes to get to their node pages.
The default page should have a way to add a node.
  (blocked; worked around) How do I assert that we have a clickable add button?
  (done) post some data
xtests
It should be possible to display an image on the node page using an image url in a tag.
The node page should have a link back to the main page.
Tags should link to a list of nodes with that tag.
