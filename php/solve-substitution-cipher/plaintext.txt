SENSITIVE HP INFORMATION 
EXTERNALLY VIA EMAIL ON A DAILY 
BASIS AND YOU ALSO CARRY AND 
USE DATA STORED ON YOUR LAPTOP 
OR DESKTOP WHICH MUST NOT BE 
AVAILABLE TO UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS. 

IN CASE THIS DATA IS INTERCEPTED
IN TRANSIT OR IF YOUR LAPTOP, 
PORTABLE MEDIA DEVICE, OR DESKTOP
IS LOST OR STOLEN, WHAT SECURITY
OBJECTIVE WILL BE ACHIEVED BY 
USING AN HP APPROVED ENCRYPTION 
SOLUTION?
