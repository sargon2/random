Say the price is $1 per item, or $1.50 for two.
The customer has options:
1. Don't buy anything
2. Buy one item for $1
3. Buy two items for $1.50
4. Buy two items for $2 in two different transactions
5. Buy three items for $2.50
6. Buy three items for $2 (can he do this?)
7. Buy three items for $3 in 3 different transactions

It seems like a price is a set of options the customer has.  Each transaction is a pass through state machine with decisions at each step.
 - The set can have infinite options in it, and even multiple infinities (buy inf items in inf transactions, or inf items in one transaction)
   - But it's never really infinite, since the store has limited stock

Buy two, get one free: does the third item have a price?
- This is a false dichotomy.  Really it's just an option in a sales state machine.

What is the value of the inventory?
- Interesting that this depends on which option the customer takes.  So a shelf has a min and a max value, and perhaps an expected value based on the options we think the customer(s) will choose.

Rounding should happen at the last possible moment.

How do you keep an audit trail?  That's the event thing.  We keep a log of events that occurred (transactions that happened along with decisions in the state machine the customer made).
