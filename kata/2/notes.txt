I kind of want to use the same test framework for all five implementations.

Should I use different languages?

1: Non-TDD; write the tests first, then implement the whole algorithm
2: Use an object to represent the current range we're examining
3: Binary search that works for data that we don't know the length of

Try to TDD up the actual algorithm itself?
