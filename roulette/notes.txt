"The wheel will spin for 20 seconds and the ball will land on a random number."

This is supposed to be a hard problem for tdd that you need mocks to solve.

Spinning for 20 seconds:
 - get the time, call the code, get the time, assert that the time that elapsed is within a bound
 - mock time.sleep

Land on a random number:
 - Call the random number generator a bunch and assert the distribution is pretty even
 - mock the code that actually generates the random number

I'm worried about edge cases with the random number.  mt_rand(0, 20) vs. mt_rand(0, 21).
