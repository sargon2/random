Requirements:
 - Any voter can verify their vote was counted correctly
 - Anyone can verify that all the votes were counted correctly
 - No voter can demonstrate how they voted to a third party

When they vote, a voter is assigned a random number in the range 1 - # of voters.  The voter writes down the number.

Then, when voting is complete, the voting system publishes a list of all those numbers with which way they voted.

But knowing the # of voters is hard.  So let's assign the numbers in blocks of N.
- Assign block 1 until it's full, then move on to block 2, etc.

Maybe there's a better way than going in blocks.  Each voter is assigned a random not-yet-assigned number in the range 0 - total # of votes so far plus N?

I don't like starting at small numbers and working towards large so much...

People with large numbers might not have a lot of neighbors, which would make their vote demonstratable.
 - They could tell someone else their number before the list is published, and then when it's on the list without any neighbors, it's clear it was correct.
We can't assign numbers sequentially since then you could know from temporal information which way someone voted.
So N needs to be large enough that you can't tell which way someone voted from temporal information, but small enough that you can't tell from the whitespace which way they voted.

When a voter looks at the list of votes, they can find their number, and verify their vote is correct in the list.
Anyone can download the entire list and count the votes to verify the totals.
Each voter knows their number, but if they tell their number to someone else, that other person can't know for sure if they're telling the truth, since it's easy to make up valid numbers.

There's another possible requirement that voting systems be "coercion-evident".

One possible solution is if voters could change their votes at any time up until the deadline.
